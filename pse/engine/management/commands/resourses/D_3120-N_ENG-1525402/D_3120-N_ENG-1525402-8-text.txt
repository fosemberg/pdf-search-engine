 @E-T-A 3120-N… Thermal Circuit Breaker Description X3120-U undervoltage release module Dimensions The undervoltage release module reliably excludes personal injury through automatic re-start after voltage dip or power failure. flat head screw M3,5xB for connection tightening torque max. 0.8 Nm 41 +01 1.814 In the event of voltage dip or power failure, the undervoltage release module trips the circuit breaker. The rocker actuator will go into cen- tre position. The breaker can be reset in two steps: Step 1: Switch rocker into OFF position. Step 2: Reset circuit breaker. o 78. Note: Basic unit 3120-------screw terminals. Not possible in combination with PT terminals. Typical applications All machines that could cause personal injury upon automatic re-start, e. g. drilling machines, electric saws, meat cutting machines etc. 6.8 260 21 827 22 .868 23.5 .925 21 .827 1 terminal X3120-J01… blade terminal DIN 46244-A2.8-0.8 (QC. 110) Without separate terminal(9): X3120-UOO… Order numbering code Schematic diagrams Type No. X3120 module for type 3120 X3120-U00… X3120-U01… X3120-U02… Module undervoltage release module Design 00 standard (without separate connections) 01 1 blade 2.8x0.8 02 2 blade terminal 2.8x0.8 11 Ilne 21 Ine 11 Ilne A2+ +21 Ilne 11 AZT 121 X31120- U 00.00 Mail Voltage ratings 00 AC 230/240 V 50/60 Hz 01 AC 120 V 50/60 Hz 02 AC 100 V 50/60 Hz 03 DC 24 V 04 AC 400 V 50/60 Hz 05 AC 42 V 50/60 Hz Supply status M module mounted to circuit breaker 3120 ordering example 120 221) 12:10 load Technical data Voltage ratings: Voltage tolerances Typical life Current consumption 121) 12(k) load 121) 12(k) AC 42 V; 100 V; 120 V; 230/240 V; 400 V (50/60 Hz) DC 24 V + 10 %/- 15 % 20,000 cycles approx. 2.5 mA load J22(K) Release values 0.2 x UN < U < 0.7 x UN Un (at a rated voltage of AC 100 V the device can trip at 70 V and must trip at 20 V) All Information and data given on our products are accurate and reliable to the best of our knowledge, hut E-T A does not accept any forthe use in applications which one not in accordance with the present specification.
