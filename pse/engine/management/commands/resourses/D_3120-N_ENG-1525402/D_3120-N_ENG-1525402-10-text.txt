 @E-T-A 3120-N… Thermal Circuit Breaker Description X3120-M remote trip module Dinner Dimensions A module which adds remote trip capability to all versions of type 3120-F. A voltage applied across the coil will cause trip of the main switch/circuit breaker mechanism… Note: Not possible in combination with PT terminals. Typical applications Electrical remote trip of safety systems.
