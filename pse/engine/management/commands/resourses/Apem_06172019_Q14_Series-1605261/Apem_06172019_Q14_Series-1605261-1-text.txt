Bi-color - The color is changed by reversing the polarity of the supply voltage. Tri-color - The indicator has red and green LEDs, when both connected yellow is produced. • The operating voltage must not be exceeded by more that 10% as this will result in reduced life LED COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS Prominent and Recessed Flush Forward Voltage expectancy • Luminous intensity is measured at 20 mA on a discrete led unless otherwise stated.
