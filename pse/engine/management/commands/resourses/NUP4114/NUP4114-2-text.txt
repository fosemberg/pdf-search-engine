Diagram of ESD Test Setup The following is taken from Application Note AND8308/D - Interpretation of Datasheet Parameters for ESD Devices. ESD Voltage Clamping For sensitive circuit elements it is important to limit the voltage that an IC will be exposed to during an ESD event to as low a voltage as possible, The ESD clamping voltage is the voltage drop across the ESD protection diode during an ESD event per the IEC61000-4-2 waveform. Since the IEC61000-4-2 was written as a pass/fail spec for larger systems such as cell phones or laptop computers it is not clearly defined in the spec how to specify a clamping voltage at the device level, ON Semiconductor has developed a way to examine the entire voltage waveform across the ESD protection diode over the time domain of an ESD pulse in the form of an oscilloscope screenshot, which can be found on the datasheets for all ESD protection diodes, For more information on how ON Semiconductor creates these screenshots and how to interpret them please refer to AND8307/D. 100 90 - 80 70 60 50 - 40 30 20 PEAK VALUE Insm @ 8 us PULSE WIDTH (1p) IS DEFINED AS THAT POINT WHERE THE PEAK CURRENT DECAY = 8 us HALF VALUE laswi2 @ 20 us o 20 40 60 80 t, TIME (us) Figure 5. 8/20 us Pulse Waveform www.ongemi.com 3
